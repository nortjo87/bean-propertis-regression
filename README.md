📂 Data

The dataset used in this project is private and confidential and therefore cannot be publicly shared.

🔒 Data Confidentiality

This dataset is obtained from spectral measurements of seed (grain) samples and is subject to data usage restrictions.
For this reason, raw data files are intentionally excluded from this repository.

📊 Dataset Characteristics

Data type: Structured spectral data

Object: Seed / grain samples

Number of samples: Multiple spectral observations

Features: Spectral values across multiple wavelengths

Target variable: Predicted seed property value (continuous numerical target)

Missing values: None (complete dataset)

🧠 Data Quality & Preprocessing

All spectral features are complete with no missing values

Spectral data were normalized and scaled prior to modeling

Noise reduction and feature transformation were applied as part of preprocessing

All preprocessing steps are fully documented in the code

🧪 Reproducibility & Transparency

Although the raw spectral dataset is not publicly available, this repository provides:

A complete preprocessing and regression modeling pipeline for spectral data

Model training, validation, and evaluation procedures

Clear documentation enabling reproduction of the workflow using synthetic or sample spectral data with the same structure

⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is intended to demonstrate machine learning methodology, spectral data analysis, and regression modeling, rather than to disclose proprietary experimental data.
